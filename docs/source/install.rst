Installation
============

The ``Boiling Flow`` package currently is only available to download and install from source through GitHub.


**Downloading and installing from source**

1. Download the source code:

In order to download the python code, move to a directory of your choice and run the following two commands::

    git clone https://github.com/jeffreyutley/boiling_flow.git
    cd boiling_flow

2. Install the conda environment and package:

It is recommended that you install to a virtual environment. There are two options to do so:

a. *Clean install from dev_scripts*

*******You can skip all other steps if you do a clean install.******

To do a clean install, use the command::

    cd dev_scripts
    source clean_install_all.sh


b. *Manual install*

If you have Anaconda installed, you can run the following::

    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate boiling_flow

This creates a conda environment ``boiling_flow`` using the ``environment.yml`` file. Now to use the package, this
``boiling_flow`` environment needs to be activated.

3. Verify Installation:

You can verify the installation by running ``pip show boiling_flow``, which should display a brief summary of the
packages installed in the ``boiling_flow`` environment. Now you will be able to use the ``boiling_flow`` python commands
from any directory by running the python command ``import boiling_flow``.
